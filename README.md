# TOT-Test
Some tests I do on "[The Outlast Trials](https://redbarrelsgames.com/games/the-outlast-trials/)", game made by [RedBarrels](https://redbarrelsgames.com/).

## Compile the project

Clone the repository using git:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/djlorenzouasset/TOT-Test
```

Open the .sln file (`TOT-Test.sln`) using Visual Studio and compile it in Release or Debug mode (up to you).
